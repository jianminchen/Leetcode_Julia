It is multiple year project to work on Leetcode algorithm. 

2015 - 2016

I worked on around 100 algorithms

2017 - 2018

I submitted 42 algorithms from May 2017 to May 2018 using Leetcode online judge. 

Every algorithm there is a story behind. I spent a lot of hours to work on those 42 algorithms. It is good idea to review those algorithms, and try to apply them in the work, mock interview.  
 
Here is the pdf file containing all algorithms I submitted last 12 month. 42 algorithms are submitted.

I write something about how many algorithm I should have completed in 12 months. The most important is to get into detail on one algorithm, for example, I should look into more ideas like slide window maximum algorithm. 

Here is the blog I wrote on this topic. http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/06/leetcode-last-12-months-42-algorithm.html
     
2018 July

I started to work on easy level algorithm, so I worked on more than 60 algorithms in less than 3 months.

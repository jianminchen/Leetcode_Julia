30 days to Meta onsite | 4th Facebook onsite | System design | Daily update - Day 3

April 4, 2022

Introduction

I like to quickly share my preparation for Meta 2022 phone screen and onsite. I like to document my learning on system design, also seek good advice and build confidence based on hard work, good learning strategies and also satisfaction through hard work, preparation, sharing and great social activities within community. Good learning and great success always come after those people hard working, taking risk, determination to make good plans, execution of plans. If you also prepare for system design interview, or algorithm interviews for Meta onsite, please drop a line in the comment area, or share your discuss post on Leetcode. If my notes can help you to practice more on Leetcode algorithms, then let me know as well.

30 days to Meta onsite | System design
I did purchase a few udemy system design and behavior courses, and started to watch those courses.

I will take some notes and then share in this discuss post if I have time.

I also had chance to watch mock onsite interview from https://www.designclub.mingdaoschool.com/interview/index.html

Books I read last 12 months to prepare system design

Google tech talks watched
Bigtable in action (Google Cloud Next '17) [Here](Bigtable in action (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaRbKdMInuc&t=1965) is the link.
Field promotion - keyword, google search - NoSQL row BigTable key design - Cloud Bigtable & time series data Here is the article.



Google bigtable, GFS, MapReduce paper
My favorite notes from Harvard, Rutgers, etc. university large distributed system lecture notes:
August 5, 2021
I like to take some time to learn Harvard lecture notes about Bigtable. Here is the link.

The following is the lecture notes with my highlights. I also like to write down my study notes to help myself to be a better learner.

Follow up on August 5, 2021 7:15 PM
I just could not believe that it is best lecture note I read in my whole life. Unbelievable!

Bigtable makes a couple data model choices relevant for our understanding.

Sparse hashtable. A Bigtable is essentially a sparse 3D hash table, where the dimensions are row names, column names, and versions (timestamps).
Strings. All Bigtable row names, column names, and data items are strings (sequences of characters). Bigtable has no true schema: everythingâ€™s a string.
Put, get, scan. Bigtable supports four fundamental operations: put (store a value in a row/column entry), get (return the value in a row/column entry), delete (delete a row/column entry), and scan (return many values from many row/column entries, in sorted order).
Algorithms I practiced before and after Meta phone screen | C# | Facebook tag | votrubac
I just could not believe that I passed Meta phone screen this year March 21, 2022, so I am preparing for onsite interviews in May, 2022.

Facts to review:

Interviewing dot io mock interview as an interviewees - four times in February, 2022.
Algorithms solved - another over 40 algorithms solved for preparation, submissions count over 100
Book chapter - written by Dr. Li - Follow the book chapter to review algorithms related to array
Lessons learned from March Microsoft onsite interviews - C#, algorithms, bugs in the code, time complexity related to HashSet. Need more practice. Work hard and review more algorithms.
It is more important to pass Meta onsite algorithm interviews compared to system design interview.
10 algorithms practiced most challenge:

Microsoft Vancouver onsite - Four rounds of algorithm interviews
I passed online code assessment in Dec. 2021, but I preferred to have more practice before I had onsite interview. I chose not to move fast because I did not practice very often from May to Dec. 2021. That is a big mistake, I should not stop practice Leetcode algorithms. It takes time to warm up and also it takes time to build habit to think hard on Leetcode algorithms, and also patience is a skill to learn again after six months break.

I continued to practice Leetcode algorithms to prepare Meta phone screen on March 21, 2022..

March 2022, monthly review
March 1 - March 7
It takes self-discipline to work on Leetcode algorithms continuously. I only have less than 200 submissions last 12 months, compared to Dr. Lai (https://leetcode.com/justyy/), over 1500 submissions, I like to learn from him. Hard work is most important, and I should discipline myself and then I can improve my crafting skills and problem solving skills.

work hard | Hard work beats talent
Do not think too much. Just work on more algorithms. Solve as many algorithms as I can. Once I solve another 20 algorithms, stop and review what I have learned, and then continue to solve another 20 algorithms.
I wrote a blog to document my plan on March 5, 2022. Good planning is important for success for any project.
I understood that I could not solve all those algorithms, I tried to go over some algorithms quickly, and found those most intersting and practice one or two, and I tried different ideas to learn from others from discuss post.

Meta phone screen, one week break, no practice. I did some research what to work on related to system design interview, and I decided to purchase some Udemy courses so that I can learn much better about large distributed system. Based on my analysis of Udemy course, for example, 15000 students, each one pays $15 dollars, the capital is $225,000 for one course. I do think that one of those courses will definitely help me in short time period.

I only had time to watch around one hour on Google BigTable and Bigtable architecture, and I plan to watch a few more.

Algorithm practice: None
Need to figure out how to spend one hour at least to work on algorithms, go over algorithms by taking some breaks, like 15 minutes, 30 minutes one time. Three times a day.

Day 3
It is an exciting day to work on Leetcode algorithm. First, I got this recipe from votrubac solution top-voted. 15 algorithms, I wrote a blog on April 1, 2022, and I made some plans to work on.

I gave this folder a new task so quickly without second thoughts. After two more months, it is the place for me to organize how I prepare Facebook phone screen and onsite. <br>
As a software engineer, it is too hard to push myself to compete best talent in the world for a senior level position. I still remembered that I was young, like in SJTU college, over 30 years ago. Life is just amazing and push me to grow, learn and make the world better place. <br>

As a software engineer, there are so many things to learn and improve. My crafting skills on coding is getting better, but how about system design, and how to take this challenging world with millions or billions to get connect, and make the world more rewarding for hard working, and also better healthy world for all of us. <br>

I will do put together good content to learn and make this experience valuable. <br>

I am preparing for Google phone screen. I like to work on more algorithms and write code continuously. Ideas like weekend coding marathon, week day coding marathon, system design on pramp.com, mock interviews on interviewing.io. <br>

I also like to learn from lessons from Microsoft phone screen, and also Facebook phone screen and onsite experience as well. <br>

I only have two weeks to prepare Google phone screen. I start to learn the importance to go over hard level algorithms, taste hard feelings to fail to solve algorithms. <br>
I will work on [those useful links on Leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/665604/important-and-useful-links-from-all-over-the-leetcode/742440). <br>
Go over more algorithm on this [Leetcode pattern Google](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/), go over hard level, medium level algorithms.<br>
I also like to go over at least 100 hard level algorithms, take 10 minutes for each algorithm, and then study solution written by [grand yang](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/4606334.html). <br>
I am speculating and try to push myself to think hard, and gain some muscle to deal with unknown algorithms. <br>

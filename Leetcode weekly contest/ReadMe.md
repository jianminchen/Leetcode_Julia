**weekly contest 107**<br>
I worked on hard level algorithm, the code had bugs in the contest so I could not pass online judge. <br>
[Here](https://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/10/ielts-reading.html) is the blog I wrote to work on my English reading skills. <br>
[Reading challenge](https://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/10/ielts-reading-related-to-algorithm.html) is found in one of easy level algorithms. <br>

**weekly contest 108**<br>
I worked on a medium level algorithm, I chose the solution to get into too much detail, such as positions of each 1 in the array. I spent one hour with 5 submissions, each extra submission 5 minutes penalty. <br>

**weekly contest 109**<br>
I worked on the second algorithm, and then I chose to write a time-consuming solution instead. I could not submit the second algorithm for technical reason. 

**weekly contest 110**<br>
This is my most favorite contest. I solved the first two algorithms, and then rest two I did spend time to read the problem statements in the contest, and also I thought about the solutions for each of them. I felt that one day I can solve four of them.

Question 3 can be solved using brute force solution. Question 4 is also can be solved using dynamic programming solution. 

**weekly contest 111**<br>
The contest was my favorite one. 
I solved question 1 and 3. And I did have problems to understand the question 2 and test case 1. 

I like to write down my experience with question 2. My problem was that I started to write code and then fixed the code, and then I found out that I should write a different solution since the requirement is different from what I thought. I should figure out the requirement first in the contest, because the time is limited. 

I read the hard level algorithm at the very beginning, and this is the first time I spent first five minutes to read hard level algorithm in the contest. <br>

**weekly contest 112**<br>

I start to challeng myself to prepare hard level algorithm in the contest. At least I will spend a few minutes to read the last algorithm and think about a few minutes at the very beginning of the contest. I also read all the algorithms first and evaluate the difficulty levels. 

After the contest, I try to push myself to solve all algorithms in an additional hour if possible. 

I like to put together the folder for each contest as well. I also like to write down my favorite learning from others. <br>


**weekly contest 113**<br>
I wrote a blog to document the frustration I had on the third algorithm in the contest. I spent over 40 minutes in the contest to solve the third algorithm. <br>

**weekly contest 117**<br>
January 2, 2018<br>
I need to figure out how to push myself to work on more algorithm problem solving every day. I have to do weekly leetcode contest, a few mock interview as an interviewer on interviewing.io. And I am doing personal finance research in the weekdays after the work and weekends.

It is hard for me to find time to work on Leetcode algorithms practice from Dec 1 to Dec. 31, 2018, I did not practice at all. 

**weekly contest 118**<br>
I solved one algorithm in the contest, but I had difficult time to solve an easy one. <br>
After the contest in over an hour, I wrote a solution for algorithm 3. 

On January 9, 2019, I wrote a solution for algorithm 3. [Here](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-binary-tree-to-match-preorder-traversal/discuss/216247/C-How-to-push-myself-to-write-an-elegant-solution) is my Leetcode discuss sharing called "How to push myself to write an elegant solution" <br>

**weekly contest 124**<br>  
I took one week break for Chinese new year spring break party in Delta, BC. I came back to play weekly contest as usual. 

**weekly contest 125**<br>  

**Weekly contest 128**<br>

This is the first time I pushed myself to spend time to study top 150 players and I like to learn how to solve the hard level algorithm in the contest from them. <br>

I did not have time to work on hard level algorithms in past 24 contests at all, neither I have time to study hard level algorithm after the contest. In total there are around 20 hard level algorithms for me to work on. I did not have time to learn and figure out a solution at all. <br>

One thing I learned is to find the source code for those players on leaderboard, instead of checking leadboard, I finally figured out those links are available and I should be able to read the code. <br>

I need to push myself to figure out if it is the good way for me to learn a hard level algorithm. I should figure out how those hard level algorithms can be solved in less than 10 minutes by so many players. I need to find out what I miss in my daily training and study.<br>

[weekly contest 128](https://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/search?q=weekly+contest+128) My favorite learning experience.<br>
I am so exciting to reach the stage for me to challenge those hard level algorithms after the contest first. One day I can show up to solve in the contest. <br>

**Weekly contest 132**<br>
I only solved one tree algorithm. I could not solve the first easy level tree algorithm using dynamic programming. I ran out of time, and the bug in the code is easy to tell. <br>
What I like to do is to work hard on algorithm practice. I have to push myself to work on algorithm problem solving daily, so that I will get used to those basic algorithm again. <br>

I have to get back to work on more graph algorithm, dynamic programming algorithm. <br>

**weekly contest 133**<br>
I was interrupted in the contest. I chatted with my friend about housing renting issues. I could not concentrate and was disrupted more than five times. I did not solve any algorithm. <br>

**weekly contest 134**<br>
April 27, 2019<br>
I solved the first two algorithms. [Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2019/04/weekly-contest-114.html) is the blog I wrote after the contest. 

March 13, 2020 <br>

I have to go back to weekly contest, and I should push myself hard at least once two hours every week, work on contest. It is good for my brain and also maintain my desire to be a best programmer in the world.

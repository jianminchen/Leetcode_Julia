It is time for me to make new year resolution for 2022. I plan to spend more time to work on Leetcode algorithms. I will have good time to practice algorithm, get motivated to solve more hard level algorithms. <br>

I do think that I should stay on the track to practice more Leetcode algorithms. <br>

Microsoft Vancouver onsite - Four rounds of algorithm interviews<br>

March 2022, monthly review<br>
March 1 - March 7<br>
It takes self-discipline to work on Leetcode algorithms continuously. I only have less than 200 submissions last 12 months, compared to Dr. Tai, over 1500 submissions, I like to learn from him. Hard work is most important, and I should discipline myself and then I can improve my crafting skills and problem solving skills. [Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2022/03/leetcode-jianmin-chen-last-12-months.html) is the blog with a title:

Do not think too much. Just work on more algorithms. Solve as many algorithms as I can. Once I solve another 20 algorithms, stop and review what I have learned, and then continue to solve another 20 algorithms. <br>
[Here](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2022/03/plan-to-work-on-leetcode-algorithms.html) is my blog written on March 5, 2022. Good planning is important for success for any project. <br>

It is time for me to make new year resolution for 2022. I plan to spend more time to work on Leetcode algorithms. I will have good time to practice algorithm, get motivated to solve more hard level algorithms. <br>

I do think that I should stay on the track to practice more Leetcode algorithms. <br>

I came back to work on algorithm since I had to prepare for Microsoft Vancouver online assessment. <br>

**It takes a village to raise a child.**<br><br>
Sept. 9, 2018<br>
I like to adapt the culture to learn from and contribute to Leetcode discuss community. It is a long journey. <br>

It took more than 3 years five months for me to understand that I also should learn to contribute to the community, I like to make the community better for learning and sharing, encouraging each other to share ideas. From January 2015, I started to work on Leetcode algorithm, three years 6 months later, July 2018 is time for me to be a writer for Leetcode discuss. <br>

This page is dedicated to show my effort to provide a feature to review all my past practice, all my sharing on Leetcode discuss. <br>

**I am the one**<br><br>

Since I am working on target to solve first 300 algorithm on Leetcode.com, I like to solve as many algorithms as possible. So it will take me some time to work on Leetcode discuss, specially on Leetcode easy level tree algorithms. I like to review those algorithms first and then I will write something to share for each algorithm. 

**Leetcode discuss**<br><br>

I will share more practice later. I also will add those links I shared before. 

Sept. 9, 2018

Leetcode.com does not provide product feature to look up discuss shared by a player. Google search result will only show at most 20 results of my discuss. 

Google search: Leetcode leetcode jianmin.chen.39

I like to list all my sharings on Tree easy level algorithms, Array easy level algorithms, Math easy level algorithms. 

**Total sharing 96 (Oct. 5, 2018)**<br>
**Total sharing 188 (Nov. 28, 2018) Easy level 122, Medium level 57, hard level 9**<br>

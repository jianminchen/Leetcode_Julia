**It takes a village to raise a child.**<br><br>

I like to adapt the culture to learn and contribute to Leetcode discuss community. It is so easy to learn from so many ideas, but it takes me more than 3 years five months to understand that I also should learn to contribute to the community. 

I like to see if I adopt the value "It takes a village to raise a child", as a programmer, I think that in order to get smart, I have to learn to contribute Leetcode discuss. Since I find that it is so easy to learn the algorithm on leetcode discuss, I like to be one of them to work hard and share the thoughts and hard work.

This page is dedicated to show my effort to provide a feature to review all my past practice, all my sharing on Leetcode discuss. 

It is time for me to share my practice on Leetcode.com discussion panel.

I like to encourage myself to share my code on Leetcode discussion. I learn so many things from those people sharing on Leetcode discussion panel. I like to be one of them. 

Since I am working on target to solve first 300 algorithm on Leetcode.com, I like to solve as many algorithms as possible. So it will take me some time to work on Leetcode discuss, specially on Leetcode easy level tree algorithms.

**Leetcode discuss**<br><br>

I will share more practice later. I also will add those links I shared before.

Leetcode.com does not provide product feature to look up discuss shared by a player. Google search result will only show at most 20 results of my discuss.

"There is no way around the hard work. Embrace it." Roger Federer<br>

I like to encourage myself to solve 240 algorithms in first six months of 2020. I know that I am super busy with full time work, and also I like to catch up learning system design as a senior programmer. But I do believe that I will become a better problem solver if I choose to work on easy level algorithms every day, and every Saturday I play weekly contest as well. <br>

To push myself hard, I need to solve 40 algorithms in one month, and I like to work on it six months. So I can complete 240 algorithms in six months. <br>

Feedback is typically broken down into four categories (Analytical Ability, Coding, Experience, and Communication) and you are given a score from 1.0 to 4.0 overall, where 2.8 is the threshold of hire vs. no-hire. Interviewer feedback is collated and sent to a hiring committee, which ultimately decides whether to move forward with an offer, reject the candidate.<br>
If your average score is below 2.8 then the feedback is not even forwarded to the hiring committee and you receive a rejection.<br>

https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-interview-feedback-form-template-look-like-at-tech-companies<br>

At the end of each interview your interviewer will grade your performance using a standardised feedback form that summarizes the attributes Google looks for in a candidate. That form is constantly evolving, but we have listed the main components we know of at the time of writing this article below.<br>

A) Questions asked<br>
In the first section of the form the interviewer fills in the questions they asked you. These questions are then shared with your future interviewers so you don't get asked the same questions twice.<br>

B) Attribute scoring<br>
Each interviewer will assess you on the four main attributes Google looks for when hiring:<br>

General cognitive ability. This is often referred to as "GCA" by Googlers. The company wants to hire smart engineers who can learn and adapt to new situations. Here your interviewer will try to understand how you solve hard problems and how you learn.<br>
Role-related knowledge and experience. This is often referred to as "RRK" or "RRKE" internally. The company wants to make sure that you have the right experience, domain expertise and competencies for the position you're applying for. For instance if you're applying for a "Softwate Engineer - Mobile" position then you'll be expected to have in depth knowledge about mobile.<br>
Leadership. Google looks for a particular type of leadership called “emergent leadership.” You'll typically be working in cross-functional teams at Google, and different team members are expected to step up and lead at different times in the lifecycle of a project when their skills are needed.<br>
Googleyness (i.e. culture fit). The company wants to make sure Google is the right environment for you. Your interviewer will check whether you naturally exhibit the company's values including: being comfortable with ambiguity, having a bias to action, and a collaborative nature.<br>
Depending on the exact job you're applying for these attributes might be broken down further. For instance, "Role-related knowledge and experience" could be broken down into "Security architecture" or "Incident response" for a site reliability engineer role. But the total number of attributes does not usually exceed six or seven.<br>

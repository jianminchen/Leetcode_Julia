"There is no way around the hard work. Embrace it." Roger Federer<br>

I like to encourage myself to solve 240 algorithms in first six months of 2020. I know that I am super busy with full time work, and also I like to catch up learning system design as a senior programmer. But I do believe that I will become a better problem solver if I choose to work on easy level algorithms every day, and every Saturday I play weekly contest as well. <br>

To push myself hard, I need to solve 40 algorithms in one month, and I like to work on it six months. So I can complete 240 algorithms in six months. <br>

Go over more algorithm on this [Leetcode pattern Google](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/), go over hard level, medium level algorithms.<br>
I also like to go over at least 100 hard level algorithms, take 10 minutes for each algorithm, and then study solution written by [grand yang](https://www.cnblogs.com/grandyang/p/4606334.html). <br>

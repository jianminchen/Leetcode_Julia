"There is no way around the hard work. Embrace it." Roger Federer<br>

I like to encourage myself to solve 240 algorithms in first six months of 2020. I know that I am super busy with full time work, and also I like to catch up learning system design as a senior programmer. But I do believe that I will become a better problem solver if I choose to work on easy level algorithms every day, and every Saturday I play weekly contest as well. <br>

To push myself hard, I need to solve 40 algorithms in one month, and I like to work on it six months.<br>
